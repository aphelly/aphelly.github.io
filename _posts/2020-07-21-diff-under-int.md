title: Differentation under the integral sign &#58; A powerful technique
---

Differentation under the integral sign is a very useful and powerful integration technique. It works under the simple understanding of Leibniz's Rule:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{a}^{b}f(x,t)dx = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(f(x,t)) dx
$$
