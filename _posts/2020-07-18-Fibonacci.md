title: Fibonacci Numbers via Linear Algebra
---

In this post, we attempt to derive an explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers via linear algebra techniques.

The Fibonacci numbers are a famous sequence of numbers in mathematics. A few beginning terms of the sequence are:
$$
\left\lbrace 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\right\rbrace 
$$
The first two terms are 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is given by the sum of the previous two terms.
